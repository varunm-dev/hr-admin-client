# HR Admin Code Client Challenge App
You are the HR admin in your company, and you recently hired a group of employees, and you
want to manage them effectively. Create an application which allows you to see the list of
employees and their details (Name, Email, Phone Number, Website).
When you click on an action on the employee row (pencil icon for edit), you will open a popup
window/modal which allows you to edit the details of the employee and save. When saved, the
updated contents should be visible in the employee table
